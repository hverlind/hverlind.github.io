A few weeks ago I came across this [blog post](http://www.annema.me/blog/post/2014/4/4/the-builder-pattern-in-objective-c) about a builder pattern for Objective-C. It was one of our interns who pointed me to the article and asked if I considered this to be a good idea. Here's what it looks like:

{% highlight objc %}

    Pizza *pizza = [Pizza pizzaWithBlock:^(PizzaBuilder *builder]) {
        builder.size = 12;
        builder.pepperoni = YES;
        builder.mushrooms = YES;
    }];

{% endhighlight %}

At first I dismissed it altogether. Being familiar with the builder pattern in C#, I considered this Objective-C variant to be somewhat contrived and lacking the typical fluent syntax characterized by method chaining.

A week or two later, I watched a video about [Building Paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiY1cheLpmI) and learned about [Pop](https://code.facebook.com/posts/234067533455773/introducing-pop-the-animation-engine-behind-paper/), the animation engine that was released by Facebook as (yet another) open source framework for iOS. Looking further into this the next day, I encountered the following code snippet in the Pop documentation:

 {% highlight objc %}

    prop = [POPAnimatableProperty propertyWithName:@"com.foo.radio.volume"
                                       initializer:^(POPMutableAnimatableProperty *prop) {
        // read value
        prop.readBlock = ^(id obj, CGFloat values[]) {
            values[0] = [obj volume];
        };
        // write value
        prop.writeBlock = ^(id obj, const CGFloat values[]) {
            [obj setVolume:values[0]];
        };
        // dynamics threshold
        prop.threshold = 0.01;
    }];

{% endhighlight %}

It's that same builder pattern again! However, there is one small but important thing that the Facebook example makes obvious and that I failed to realize before: *there is no need to add dedicated builder objects to Objective-C because they are already present in the language in the form of mutable objects.* In fact, this allows us to implement the builder patter in a more generic way, e.g. as a category on `NSObject`:

{% highlight objc %}

    @interface NSObject (Builder)

    - (instancetype)initUsingBlock:(void(^)(id mutableCopy))block;

    @end

    @implementation NSObject (Builder)

    - (instancetype)initUsingBlock:(void(^)(id mutableCopy))block
    {
        self = [self init];
        if (self && block)
        {
            id mutableCopy = [self mutableCopy];
            block(mutableCopy);
            self = [mutableCopy copy];
        }
        return self;
    }

    @end

{% endhighlight %}

There are some obvious limitations with this simple approach (most notably it only works for default initializers), but without adding anything else we can now start writing code like this:

{% highlight objc %}

    NSParagraphStyle *paragraphStyle =
    [[NSParagraphStyle alloc] initUsingBlock:^(NSMutableParagraphStyle *paragraphStyle) {
        paragraphStyle.alignment = NSTextAlignmentCenter;
        paragraphStyle.lineSpacing = 0.0;
    }];
    
    NSDictionary *attributes = @{ NSParagraphStyleAttributeName : paragraphStyle };
    
    NSAttributedString *text =
    [[NSAttributedString alloc] initUsingBlock:^(NSMutableAttributedString *text) {
        [text appendAttributedString:[[NSAttributedString alloc] initWithString:paragraph1]];
        [text appendAttributedString:[[NSAttributedString alloc] initWithString:paragraph2
                                                                     attributes:attributes]];
        [text appendAttributedString:[[NSAttributedString alloc] initWithString:paragraph3]];
    }];

{% endhighlight %}

The same implementation can be reused for all other classes with mutable variants. Instead of implementing a `PizzaBuilder` class with a `build` method, and adding an `initWithBuilder` method in the `Pizza` class, we just need to implement a `MutablePizza` class and the default copy methods. This limits boilerplate code to a bare minimum and makes the builder pattern a more natural fit for the language.
