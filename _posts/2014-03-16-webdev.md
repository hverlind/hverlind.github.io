I'll admit it, I have never been much of a web developer. Sure, I once built a website, somewhere around the start of the century. It included a guestbook, a visitor counter and a LED ticker display. It was hosted on a free .tk domain. You get the idea. But ever since  things got a bit more serious, I mostly tried to stay away from web development.

I once used to blog as well. At a previous company I worked for, I contributed to the technical blog once a month for three years straight. But I never had a personal blog before. My main excuse has always been that I don't want to deal with the overhead of building a website and keeping it alive. I have considered blogging on a platform like [Medium](http://medium.com), but I tend to agree with [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx), who claims that as a developer, not only should you have your own blog, but you should also buy your own domain in order to keep control over your content.

So what changed? Two things. First, I came across this post by [Amy Hoy](http://unicornfree.com/2014/dont-fave-this-post-how-to-really-launch-in-2014). Her advice to just start small -- one tiny step after another -- may sound pretty obvious, but it was still a bit of a wake up call for me. Second, I realized just how much web development has matured over the past few years and how easy it has become to set up, deploy and maintain something like a static blog site.

You don't need to know any Ruby to install gems like [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) or [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). You just play around with some open source templates until you find something you like. You link your domain to [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and you can be up and running in a matter of minutes. Call me old-fashioned, but I think there's something quite magical about being able to deploy a website simply by typing git push.

So here you have it. A first tiny step. The beginning of something. No promises about frequent updates. No begging to subscribe to my RSS feed. But no more excuses either.
