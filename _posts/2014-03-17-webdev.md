I'll admit it, I have never been much of a web developer. Sure, I once built a website, somewhere around the start of the century. It included a guestbook, a visitor counter and a LED ticker display. It was hosted on a free .tk domain. You get the idea. But ever since  things got a bit more serious, I mostly stayed away from web development.

I once used to blog as well. At a previous company I worked for, I contributed to the technical blog once a month for three years straight. But I never had a personal blog before. My main excuse has always been that I don't want to deal with the overhead of building a website and keeping it alive. I have considered blogging on a platform like <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>, but I also tend to agree with <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx">Scott Hanselman</a>, who claims that as a developer, you should not only have your own blog, but you should also buy your own domain in order to keep control over your content.

So what changed? Two things. First, I came across this post by <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2014/dont-fave-this-post-how-to-really-launch-in-2014">Amy Hoy</a>. Her advice to just start small -- one tiny step after another -- may sound pretty obvious, but it was still a bit of a wake up call for me. Second, I realized just how much web development has matured over the past few years and how easy it has become to setup, deploy and maintain something like a static blog site.

You don't need to know any Ruby to install gems like <a href="http://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a> or <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Play around with some open source templates until you find something you like. Link your domain to <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> and you can be up and running in a matter of minutes. Call me old-fashioned, but there's something magical about deploying a website by typing git push.


You can set customize post covers, and other things directly in the post front matter:
