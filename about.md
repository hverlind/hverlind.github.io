I have been writing code professionally for about a decade now, working for software companies active in Packaging, Marketing and Mobile. I prefer working with iOS, but I also have a background in Mac OS X and .NET development.

Currently I am working as an iOS developer for [In the Pocket](http://inthepocket.mobi). Later this year, I will be joining the iOS team at [Facebook London](https://www.facebook.com/facebooklondon).

I like speaking at conferences:

- mdevcon 2014 -- Amsterdam -- [Building an iBeacon killer app](https://speakerdeck.com/hverlind/building-an-ibeacon-killer-app)
- \#Pragma 2014 -- Milan -- [Seamless device communication](https://speakerdeck.com/hverlind/seamless-device-communication)

When off duty, I enjoy running and entertaining my two children.
