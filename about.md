I have been writing code professionally for about a decade now, working for software companies active in Packaging, Marketing and Mobile. I prefer working with iOS/Cocoa Touch/Objective-C, but I also have a background in Mac OS X and .NET development.

Currently I am working as an iOS developer for [In the Pocket](http://inthepocket.mobi).

When off duty, I enjoy running and entertaining my two children.
